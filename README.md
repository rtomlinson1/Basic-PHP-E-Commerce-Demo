# Basic-PHP-E-Commerce-Demo
This is not something I would ever consider using in production and is nearly all data is stored in the session.

This is a demonstration page that creates a simple login system and cart that is connected to a database (although all cart data is stored in the session). I made this while I was a student last year, and have updated it to utilize bulma, as well as fixing some issues and adding new functionality. 
Products and users are stored in the database, and there are three user levels, with different navbars for each type. I realize this is not how e-commerce sites are built and I would not encourage anyone to build one in this manner. It is a tool for learning about PHP's integration with MYSQL and utilizing php sessions. I have removed all database connection information, so if you want to play around with this site you will need to recreate a database and modify the config and mysql files in the includes folder. If you want to see the site live, follow the link to one of my webpages where it is hosted.

If you are interested in seeing the features of a logged in user, please contact me and I will create a user for you.
